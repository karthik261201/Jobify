[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

[Nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid)

The nanoid package is a software library used for generating unique and compact identifiers in web applications or databases. It creates short and URL-safe IDs by combining random characters from a set of 64 characters. Nanoid is a popular choice due to its simplicity, efficiency, and collision-resistant nature.

#### Not Found and Error Middleware

The "not found" middleware in Express.js is used when a request is made to a route that does not exist. It catches these requests and responds with a 404 status code, indicating that the requested resource was not found.

On the other hand, the "error" middleware in Express.js is used to handle any errors that occur during the processing of a request. It is typically used to catch unexpected errors or exceptions that are not explicitly handled in the application code. It logs the error and sends a 500 status code, indicating an internal server error.

In summary, the "not found" middleware is specifically designed to handle requests for non-existent routes, while the "error" middleware is a catch-all for handling unexpected errors that occur during request processing.

#### MongoDB

[MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. It uses a document-oriented model, where data is organized into collections of JSON-like documents. MongoDB offers high performance, horizontal scalability, and easy integration with modern development frameworks, making it suitable for handling diverse data types and handling large-scale applications.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB, offering automated deployment, scaling, and monitoring of MongoDB clusters, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

#### Mongoosejs

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a straightforward and elegant way to interact with MongoDB. It allows developers to define schemas and models for their data, providing structure and validation. Mongoose also offers features like data querying, middleware, and support for data relationships, making it a powerful tool for building MongoDB-based applications.

#### express-async-errors

[Express Async Errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors)

The "express-async-errors" package is an Express.js middleware that helps handle errors that occur within asynchronous functions. It catches unhandled errors inside async/await functions and forwards them to Express.js's error handling middleware, preventing the Node.js process from crashing. It simplifies error handling in Express.js applications by allowing you to write asynchronous code without worrying about manually catching and forwarding errors.


#### Status Codes

[Http Status Codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes)

A library for HTTP status codes is useful because it provides a comprehensive and standardized set of codes that represent the outcome of HTTP requests. It allows developers to easily understand and handle different scenarios during web development, such as successful responses, client or server errors, redirects, and more. By using a status code library, developers can ensure consistent and reliable communication between servers and clients, leading to better error handling and improved user experience.

#### Hash Passwords

[bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
This line generates a random "salt" value that will be used to hash the password. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before hashing, which helps to make the resulting hash more resistant to attacks like dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks. The genSalt() function in bcrypt generates a random salt value using a specified "cost" value. The cost value determines how much CPU time is needed to calculate the hash, and higher cost values result in stronger hashes that are more resistant to attacks.

In this example, a cost value of 10 is used to generate the salt. This is a good default value that provides a good balance between security and performance. However, you may need to adjust the cost value based on the specific needs of your application.

const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
This line uses the generated salt value to hash the password. The hash() function in bcrypt takes two arguments: the password to be hashed, and the salt value to use for the hash. It then calculates the hash value using a one-way hash function and the specified salt value.

The resulting hash value is a string that represents the hashed password. This string can then be stored in a database or other storage mechanism to be compared against the user's password when they log in.

By using a salt value and a one-way hash function, bcrypt helps to ensure that user passwords are stored securely and are resistant to attacks like password cracking and brute-force attacks.

##### BCRYPT VS BCRYPTJS

bcrypt and bcryptjs are both popular libraries for hashing passwords in Node.js applications. However, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for a few reasons:

Cross-platform compatibility: bcrypt is a native Node.js module that uses C++ bindings, which can make it difficult to install and use on some platforms. bcryptjs, on the other hand, is a pure JavaScript implementation that works on any platform.

Security: While both bcrypt and bcryptjs use the same underlying algorithm for hashing passwords, bcryptjs is designed to be more resistant to certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks.

Ease of use: bcryptjs has a simpler and more intuitive API than bcrypt, which can make it easier to use and integrate into your application.

Overall, while bcrypt and bcryptjs are both good choices for hashing passwords in Node.js applications, bcryptjs is considered to be a better choice for its cross-platform compatibility, improved security, ease of use, and ongoing maintenance.


#### JSON Web Token

[Useful Resource](https://jwt.io/introduction)

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and secure way of transmitting data between parties. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs. JWTs contain information about the user and additional metadata, and can be used to securely transmit this information

#### HTTP Only Cookie

An HTTP-only cookie is a cookie that can't be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser. It is designed to help prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal cookies and other sensitive information.

##### HTTP Only Cookie VS Local Storage

An HTTP-only cookie is a type of cookie that is designed to be inaccessible to JavaScript running in the browser. It is primarily used for authentication purposes and is a more secure way of storing sensitive information like user tokens. Local storage, on the other hand, is a browser-based storage mechanism that is accessible to JavaScript, and is used to store application data like preferences or user-generated content. While local storage is convenient, it is not a secure way of storing sensitive information as it can be accessed and modified by JavaScript running in the browser.

#### Concurrently

The concurrently npm package is a utility that allows you to run multiple commands concurrently in the same terminal window. It provides a convenient way to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.

By default, when a command fails, concurrently continues running the remaining commands. However, when --kill-others-on-fail is specified, if any of the commands fail, concurrently will immediately terminate all the other running commands.

#### Axios

[Axios Docs](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

Axios is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests from web browsers or Node.js. It provides a simple and elegant API for performing asynchronous HTTP requests, supporting features such as making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, handling request and response headers, handling request cancellation, and more.

#### React Router - Action

Route actions are the "writes" to route loader "reads". They provide a way for apps to perform data mutations with simple HTML and HTTP semantics while React Router abstracts away the complexity of asynchronous UI and revalidation. This gives you the simple mental model of HTML + HTTP (where the browser handles the asynchrony and revalidation) with the behavior and UX capabilities of modern SPAs.

#### useNavigation() and navigation.state

This hook tells you everything you need to know about a page navigation to build pending navigation indicators and optimistic UI on data mutations. Things like:

- Global loading indicators
- Adding busy indicators to submit buttons

Navigation State

idle - There is no navigation pending.
submitting - A route action is being called due to a form submission using POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE
loading - The loaders for the next routes are being called to render the next page

#### Update User - Server

Multer is a popular middleware package for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js web applications. It is commonly used for handling file uploads. Multer simplifies the process of accepting and storing files submitted through HTTP requests by providing an easy-to-use API. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js and allows developers to define upload destinations, file size limits, and other configurations.

#### Cloudinary - Create Account/Get API Keys

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

Cloudinary is a cloud-based media management platform that helps businesses store, optimize, and deliver images and videos across the web. It provides developers with an easy way to upload, manipulate, and serve media assets, enabling faster and more efficient delivery of visual content on websites and applications. Cloudinary also offers features like automatic resizing, format conversion, and responsive delivery to ensure optimal user experiences across different devices and network conditions.

#### Stats - Complete Server Functionality

[MongoDB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/)

The MongoDB aggregation pipeline is like a factory line for data. Data enters, it goes through different stages like cleaning, sorting, or grouping, and comes out at the end changed in some way. It's a way to process data inside MongoDB.


#### Debounce

[JS Nuggets - Debounce](https://youtu.be/tYx6pXdvt1s)

In JavaScript, debounce is a way to limit how often a function gets called. It helps prevent rapid or repeated function executions by introducing a delay. This is useful for tasks like handling user input, where you want to wait for a pause before triggering an action to avoid unnecessary processing.

  if (req.file) {
    const file = formatImage(req.file);
    const response = await cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(file);
    newUser.avatar = response.secure_url;
    newUser.avatarPublicId = response.public_id;
  }
  const updatedUser = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.user.userId, newUser);

  if (req.file && updatedUser.avatarPublicId) {
    await cloudinary.v2.uploader.destroy(updatedUser.avatarPublicId);
  }
  res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json({ msg: 'update user' });
};
```

#### Setup Global Loading

- create loading component (import/export)
- check for loading in DashboardLayout page

components/Loading.jsx

```js
const Loading = () => {
  return <div className='loading'></div>;
};

export default Loading;
```

DashboardLayout.jsx

```js
import { useNavigation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Loading } from '../components';

const DashboardLayout = ({ isDarkThemeEnabled }) => {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const isPageLoading = navigation.state === 'loading';

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      ...
      <div className='dashboard-page'>
        {isPageLoading ? <Loading /> : <Outlet context={{ user }} />}
      </div>
      ...
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
```

#### React Query

React Query is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization in React applications. It provides a declarative and intuitive way to manage remote data by abstracting away the complex logic of fetching and caching data from APIs. React Query offers features like automatic background data refetching, optimistic updates, pagination support, and more, making it easier to build performant and responsive applications that rely on fetching and manipulating data.

[React Query Docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview)

- in the client

```sh
npm i @tanstack/react-query@4.29.5 @tanstack/react-query-devtools@4.29.6
```

App.jsx

```js
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';

const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5,
    },
  },
});

const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
      <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};
```

#### Page Error Element

- create components/ErrorElement

```js
import { useRouteError } from 'react-router-dom';

const Error = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();
  console.log(error);
  return <h4>There was an error...</h4>;
};
export default ErrorElement;
```

Stats.jsx

```js
export const loader = async () => {
  const response = await customFetch.get('/jobs/stats');
  return response.data;
};
```

App.jsx

```js
{
  path: 'stats',
  element: <Stats />,
  loader: statsLoader,
  errorElement: <h4>There was an error...</h4>
},
```

```js
{
  path: 'stats',
  element: <Stats />,
  loader: statsLoader,
  errorElement: <ErrorElement />,
},
```

#### First Query

- navigate to stats

Stats.jsx

```js
import { ChartsContainer, StatsContainer } from '../components';
import customFetch from '../utils/customFetch';
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const loader = async () => {
  return null;
};

const Stats = () => {
  const response = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['stats'],
    queryFn: () => customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'),
  });
  console.log(response);
  if (response.isLoading) {
    return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>react query</h1>;
  return (
    <>
      <StatsContainer defaultStats={defaultStats} />
      {monthlyApplications?.length > 1 && (
        <ChartsContainer data={monthlyApplications} />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
export default Stats;
```

```js
const data = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['stats'],
  queryFn: () => customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'),
});
```

const data = useQuery({ ... });: This line declares a constant variable named data and assigns it the result of the useQuery hook. The useQuery hook is provided by React Query and is used to perform data fetching.

queryKey: ['stats'],: The queryKey property is an array that serves as a unique identifier for the query. In this case, the query key is set to ['stats'], indicating that this query is fetching statistics related to jobs.

queryFn: () => customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'),: The queryFn property specifies the function that will be executed when the query is triggered. In this case, it uses an arrow function that calls customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'). The customFetch object is likely a custom wrapper around the fetch function or an external HTTP client library, used to make the actual API request to retrieve job statistics.In React Query, the queryFn property expects a function that returns a promise. The promise should resolve with the data you want to fetch and store in the query cache.

customFetch.get('/jobs/stats'): This line is making an HTTP GET request to the /jobs/stats endpoint, which is the API route that provides the job statistics data.

#### Get Stats with React Query

```js
const statsQuery = {
  queryKey: ['stats'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await customFetch.get('/jobs/stats');
    return response.data;
  },
};

export const loader = async () => {
  return null;
};

const Stats = () => {
  const { isLoading, isError, data } = useQuery(statsQuery);

  if (isLoading) return <h4>Loading...</h4>;
  if (isError) return <h4>Error...</h4>;
  // after loading/error or ?.
  const { defaultStats, monthlyApplications } = data;

  return (
    <>
      <StatsContainer defaultStats={defaultStats} />
      {monthlyApplications?.length > 1 && (
        <ChartsContainer data={monthlyApplications} />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
export default Stats;
```

#### React Query in Stats Loader

App.jsx

```js
{
  path: 'stats',
  element: <Stats />,
  loader: statsLoader(queryClient),
  errorElement: <ErrorElement />,
},
```

Stats.jsx

```js
import { ChartsContainer, StatsContainer } from '../components';
import customFetch from '../utils/customFetch';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const statsQuery = {
  queryKey: ['stats'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await customFetch.get('/jobs/statss');
    return response.data;
  },
};

export const loader = (queryClient) => async () => {
  const data = await queryClient.ensureQueryData(statsQuery);
  return data;
};

const Stats = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(statsQuery);
  const { defaultStats, monthlyApplications } = data;

  return (
    <>
      <StatsContainer defaultStats={defaultStats} />
      {monthlyApplications?.length > 1 && (
        <ChartsContainer data={monthlyApplications} />
      )}
    </>
  );
};
export default Stats;
```

#### React Query for Current User

DashboardLayout.jsx

```js
const userQuery = {
  queryKey: ['user'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const { data } = await customFetch('/users/current-user');
    return data;
  },
};

export const loader = (queryClient) => async () => {
  try {
    return await queryClient.ensureQueryData(userQuery);
  } catch (error) {
    return redirect('/');
  }
};

const Dashboard = ({ prefersDarkMode, queryClient }) => {
  const { user } = useQuery(userQuery)?.data;
};
```

#### Invalidate Queries

      queryClient.invalidateQueries();
      toast.success('Login successful');
      return redirect('/dashboard');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error.response.data.msg);
      return error;
    }
  };
```

    if (file && file.size > 500000) {
      toast.error('Image size too large');
      return null;
    }
    try {
      await customFetch.patch('/users/update-user', formData);
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['user']);
      toast.success('Profile updated successfully');
      return redirect('/dashboard');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error(error?.response?.data?.msg);
      return null;
    }
  };
```

      search ?? '',
      jobStatus ?? 'all',
      jobType ?? 'all',
      sort ?? 'newest',
      page ?? 1,
    ],
    queryFn: async () => {

        params,
      });
      return data;
    },
  };
};

export const loader =
  (queryClient) =>
  async ({ request }) => {
    const params = Object.fromEntries([
      ...new URL(request.url).searchParams.entries(),
    ]);

    await queryClient.ensureQueryData(allJobsQuery(params));
    return { searchValues: { ...params } };
  };

const AllJobs = () => {

#### Axios Interceptors

DashboardLayout.jsx

```js
const DashboardContext = createContext();

const DashboardLayout = ({ isDarkThemeEnabled }) => {
  const [isAuthError, setIsAuthError] = useState(false);

  const logoutUser = async () => {
    await customFetch.get('/auth/logout');
    toast.success('Logging out...');
    navigate('/');
  };

  customFetch.interceptors.response.use(
    (response) => {
      return response;
    },
    (error) => {
      if (error?.response?.status === 401) {
        setIsAuthError(true);
      }
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
  );
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isAuthError) return;
    logoutUser();
  }, [isAuthError]);
  return (
    ...
